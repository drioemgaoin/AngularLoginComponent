# Description
It is a token-based authentication component for AngularJS with built-in support for Google and Facebook OAuth providers, as well as Email and Password sign-in.

Obviously, you can add others OAuth providers such as Twitter, Github, etc or add any OAuth 1.0 or OAuth 2.0 provider like Sahat Yalkabov  mentioned in the Satellizer's README.

# Installation
To install this component, you need to follow the following steps:
- Clone or download the project
- Run ```npm install && bower install``` to install bower/npm dependencies
- Run ```npm default``` to build and run the project

There are 3 ways to build and run the project:
- ```gulp default```: build the project without minifying. Use it for development version.
- ```gulp default --production```: build the project with minifying. Use it for production version.
- ```gulp default --debug```: build the project with debugging. Use it when you want to check which files are used during each step of the build process.

# Installation inside AngularMicroServicesBoilerplate
After running the gulp task add (see the README of AngularMicroServicesBoilerplate), you need to add the resolve part in the home.js file of the boilerplate.
```
$stateProvider
  .state('home', {
    ...
    resolve: {
      skipIfLoggedIn: routeProvider.loginRequired
    }
  });
```

And add $stateProvider and routeProvider as parameters of the function
```
module.exports = function($stateProvider, routeProvider) {
  ...
};
```

Finally, you need to have, for your home.js file, something like
```
module.exports = function($stateProvider, routeProvider) {
  .state('home', {
    ...
    resolve: {
      skipIfLoggedIn: routeProvider.loginRequired
    }
  });
};
```
